This is my repo for following along with [The MERN Stack Tutorial](https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/).

 I've made changes and fixes for various styling and code issues I found along the way (a notable lack of a Deletion action for one).  

## Prerequisites  

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - A javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript engine.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.  

### Optional Software  

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - A package manager that doubles down as project manager.
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - A tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.  

## Install 

Clone this repo.  

In each sub-directory, run `yarn` or `npm` to install depedencies before attempting to run either application.  

## Getting Started 

### Start the Back-End  

In your favorite Terminal, change to `mern-crud-tutorial\mern-todo-backend` and run `npm start`  

#### Using Nodemon for auto-restarting the Back-End  

[The MERN Stack Tutorial](https://codingthesmartway.com/the-mern-stack-tutorial-building-a-react-crud-application-from-start-to-finish-part-1/) recommends using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to auto-restart `server.js` when a code-change is made. This is not mandatory, but can be useful.  

Install it with: `npm install -g nodemon` or `yarn global add nodemon` 

Instead of `npm start`, use `nodemon server.js`  

### Start the Front-End 

In another tab of your Favorite Terminal, change to the `mern-crud-tutorial\mern-todo-app` and run `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the React app.
